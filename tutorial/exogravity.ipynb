    "\n",
    "To be improved\n",
    "\n",

    "scripts executable (`chmod +x`), add to path. Test it. You’re done!\n",

    "Usage\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The exoGravity package provides 3 scripts, which should be used\n",
    "sequentially to reduce the data. The scripts are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `astrometry_reduce.py`: is used to extract the astrometry from the\n",
    "    observations. The script will output the best astrometry on the\n",
    "    terminal, and will add the astrometric solution for each `planet_oi`\n",
    "    in the YAML configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `spectrum_reduce.py`: is used to extract the spectrum from the\n",
    "    observations. The script will create a “contrast.txt” and\n",
    "    “covariance.txt”, to store the final spectrum and its error bars.\n",
    "    Ideally, an astrometric solution should be provided for each planet\n",
    "    observation in the YAML configuration file. If not, the script will\n",
    "    assume the fiber to be perfectly centered on the planet, which may\n",
    "    lead to bad results.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `swap_reduce.py` is only used for off-axis observations, for which\n",
    "    the astrometry of the reference binary is not known with enough\n",
    "    precision. This script will extract he astrometric solution for the\n",
    "    binary from the observations themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scripts use a common YAML configuration file, which describes the\n",
    "data files, the reduction parameters, etc. The exoGravity package comes\n",
    "with a tool to help you create a properly formatted YAML file:\n",
    "`create_config.py`. This script takes at least one argument, which is\n",
    "the path to the directory in which the astrored files are stored. It\n",
    "goes through the files, identifies on-planet, on-star, and swap\n",
    "observations, and created an associated config file. lease see the\n",
    "documentation for further options.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these scripts, start by putting all the “astrored” files\n",
    "corresponding to your observation (i.e. on-planet, on-star, possibly\n",
    "swap reference) in a common directory. To test the scripts, you can use\n",
    "one of the directory contained in the `examples` directory of this\n",
    "tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a configuration file from scratch yourself, it is\n",
    "strongly advised to use the script provided, and to tweak the parameters\n",
    "afterwards. Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "create_config.py datadir=./examples/betaPictoris_2018/ output=betaPictoris2018.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create the YAML file. You can now open it with a text editor.\n",
    "For this demo, we will change a few parameters to accelerate the\n",
    "reduction. First, in the `general` section, look for the `gofast`\n",
    "parameter, and set it to `true`. Then, search for the number of points\n",
    "in the RA/DEC maps (`n_ra` and `n_dec`, and set them to 50 instead of\n",
    "the default 100). Note that these changes could also have been requested\n",
    "at the creation of the file, by calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "create_config.py datadir=./examples/betaPictoris_2018/ output=betaPictoris2018.yml gofast=True nra=50 ndec=50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last change we will make is to skip the reduction of some of the\n",
    "files. The YAML format supports commenting (with the char `#`). In the\n",
    "`general` section of the configuration file, look for the `reduce`\n",
    "keyword. This gives a list (one element per line, preceded by a dash, as\n",
    "per YAML specification) of keys to the planet files that will be\n",
    "reduced. The keys refer to the elements of the `planet_ois` section of\n",
    "this same configuration file. For this example, we will only keep the\n",
    "first 5 files.\n",
    "\n",
