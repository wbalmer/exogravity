    "------------\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Tested on Linux/Fedora 33, 34\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python 2.7 or Python 3.x, ideally with x\\>=5 (required for\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Astropy (\\>=2.0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   ruamel.yaml \\>=0.16.5 (recommended) or alternatively pyyaml \\>=3.11\n",

    "\n",
    "### Installation procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Download or clone cleanGravity: https://gitlab.obspm.fr/mnowak/cleanGravity\n",
    "Add the directory to your python path, so that you can then import the package\n",
    "in any of your python code: \"import cleanGravity as cg\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Download or clone exoGravity, https://gitlab.obspm.fr/mnowak/exoGravity and make\n",
    "all the following scripts executable (`chmod +x`): create_config.py, create_phase_reference.py, astrometry_reduce.py, spectrum_reduce.py, swap_reduce.py, normalize_spectrum.py, plot_spectrum.py.\n",
    "Optionally, you can the directory to your path, so that you can execute these scripts from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The exoGravity package provides a number of scripts, which should be used\n",
    "sequentially to reduce the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scripts are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `create_phase_ref.py`: is used to extract the phase reference from the data, and to write it\n",
    "    directly in the fits files.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   `astrometry_reduce.py`: is used to extract the astrometry from the\n",
    "    observations. The script will output the best astrometry on the\n",
    "    terminal, and will add the astrometric solution for each `planet_oi`\n",
    "    in the YAML configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `spectrum_reduce.py`: is used to extract the spectrum from the\n",
    "    observations. The script will create a “contrast.txt” and\n",
    "    “covariance.txt”, to store the final spectrum and its error bars.\n",
    "    Ideally, an astrometric solution should be provided for each planet\n",
    "    observation in the YAML configuration file. If not, the script will\n",
    "    assume the fiber to be perfectly centered on the planet, which may\n",
    "    lead to bad results.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `swap_reduce.py` is only used for off-axis observations, for which\n",
    "    the astrometry of the reference binary is not known with enough\n",
    "    precision. This script will extract he astrometric solution for the\n",
    "    binary from the observations themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scripts use a common YAML configuration file, which describes the\n",
    "data files, the reduction parameters, etc. The exoGravity package comes\n",
    "with a tool to help you create a properly formatted YAML file:\n",
    "`create_config.py`. This script takes at least one argument, which is\n",
    "the path to the directory in which the astrored files are stored. It\n",
    "goes through the files, identifies on-planet, on-star, and swap\n",
    "observations, and created an associated config file. lease see the\n",
    "documentation for further options.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these scripts, start by putting all the “astrored” files\n",
    "corresponding to your observation (i.e. on-planet, on-star, possibly\n",
    "swap reference) in a common directory. To test the scripts, you can download\n",
    "a dataset from the exoGravity Nextcloud, for example the dataset obtained on\n",
    "beta Pic c, on Mar, 10, 2020:\n",
    " LINK\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a configuration file from scratch yourself, it is\n",
    "strongly advised to use the script provided, and to tweak the parameters\n",
    "afterwards. Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "create_config.py datadir=./2020-03-08/ output=betaPictorisc2020.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create the YAML file. You can now open it with a text editor.\n",
    "For this demo, we will change a few parameters to accelerate the\n",
    "reduction. First, in the `general` section, look for the `gofast`\n",
    "parameter, and set it to `true`. Then, search for the number of points\n",
    "in the RA/DEC maps (`n_ra` and `n_dec`, and set them to 50 instead of\n",
    "the default 100). Note that these changes could also have been requested\n",
    "at the creation of the file, by calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "create_config.py datadir=./2020-03-08/ output=betaPictorisc2020.yml gofast=True nra=50 ndec=50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last change we will make is to skip the reduction of some of the\n",
    "files. The YAML format supports commenting (with the char `#`). In the\n",
    "`general` section of the configuration file, look for the `reduce`\n",
    "keyword. This gives a list (one element per line, preceded by a dash, as\n",
    "per YAML specification) of keys to the planet files that will be\n",
    "reduced. The keys refer to the elements of the `planet_ois` section of\n",
    "this same configuration file. For this example, we will only keep the\n",
    "first 5 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `general` section of you config file should now look something like:\n",

    "      star_diameter: 0.0\n",
    "      star_order: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can create the phase reference from the on-star files, which will be used\n",
    "to correct the on-planet observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "create_phase_reference.py config_file=betaPictorisc2020.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then calculate the astrometry of the planet:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "astrometry_reduce.py config_file=betaPictorisc2020.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, the script will output some information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[INFO]: t=157.20s RA: -70.96+-2.059 mas\n",
    "[INFO]: t=157.20s DEC: -120.44+-1.930 mas\n",

    "[INFO]: t=157.20s Contrast obtained (mean, min, max): 5.22e-05, 3.94e-05, 6.29e-05\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first RA/DEC solution is simply taken from the average of the solutions found on each file.\n",
    "However, the structure of the chi2 maps is such that are always multiple minimums. When\n",
    "the chi2 values of successive minimums are similar, the noise between files can make\n",
    "the solution jump from one minimum to another one between different files, resulting\n",
    "in a biased astrometry, with large error bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second estimate uses the combined chi2 map (sum of the chi2 maps obtained\n",
    "with each files) to estimate the best global minimum, which is then used as a starting point\n",
    "for a gradient descent on each individual chi2 map, to obtain the local minimum closest to\n",
    "the global minimum. This has the advantage of giving a more robust solution, while also \n",
    "allowing to estimate the error bars from the distribution of solutions found on each \n",
    "file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the range of planet to star contrast values used to fit the planet fringes is displayed,\n",
    "as a way to quickly see if the algorithm has found a \"reasonable planet\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In that example, the difference between the two solutions, and the large error bars on the\n",
    "first solution are strongly suggestive of a chi2 minimum jump. To check this, the best way\n",
    "is to request the software to save some images and data. This can be done by tweaking\n",
    "the configuration file to add a directory where to store this (figdir option):\n",
    "\n",
    "      figdir: /path/to/a/dir/\n",

    "section, each element which was not commented in the `reduce` list now\n",
